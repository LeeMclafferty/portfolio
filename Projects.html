    <header class="descriptionhead"> Hi, Im Ron</header>
	<p	class="projectinfo">
	Hi I'm Lee, but to left you can see my current WIP Hi, I'm Ron. This game is my attempt to make a small,
	but well-polished game. I also want to have a big focus on well written, unit testable code, since that is something
	that is missing from some of my older projects. I am working on this project with the mindset "I am the programmer",
	but what does that mean? Well in Hi, I'm Ron I am using the story from one of my favorite podcast and art from outside
	sources such as Sketchfab and other asset stores. This will be a 1 - 2 level game that the objective is to solve a 
	puzzle and reveal the key to leave the bad memory for Ron's childhood.

    <header class="descriptionhead"> C++ Unreal AI </header>
	<p	class="projectinfo">
	Artificial intelligence is something that fascinates me and I want to continue exploring. In this project
	I wanted to dive into the source code behind Behavior Trees and Tasks in unreal engine. This was a great
	first experience with AI and seeing exactly what dependencies go into the system outside of blueprint scripting.

    <header class="descriptionhead"> Interactive Systems Prototype</header>
	<p	class="projectinfo">
	This project was made with 3 goals in mind. I wanted to learn how multiplayer replication worked,
	learn more about dynamic interaction systems, and how to use unreal's UMG system. In this prototype I was 
	able to write a c++ based invnetory and interaction system that is multiplayer compatible and component based
	so that I am able to attach an inventory or interaction to any Actor in the the world. In addition to that
	I was able to make a main menu, character creation system and local multiplayer that can connect 
	via himatchi all in the ui.

    <header class="descriptionhead"> Tic Tac Glow</header>
	<p	class="projectinfo">
	Tic Tac Glow was made around the time I was planning on making the interaction prototype. I set out
	to test my new found knowledge on replication in video games. I spent a weekend practicing the techniques
	that I learned and how to better scope games for myself. The video is presnted more in an entertainment 
	style since that I wanted at the time, but it will give you a change to know me a little better!

    <header class="descriptionhead"> Sea Tek Treasure Recovery</header>
	<p	class="projectinfo">
	Underwater game design is hard. Not a programming lession, but a lesson I learned making this game. SeaTek 
	Treasure recovery was made in 7 days for an itch.io game jam. It was the first time I was able to due things 
	the right way and have a heavy focus on functionality then assets. Its a mistake I made with my interaction system 
	prototype that I do not want to make again. To the left you will see a video montage of all the steps I took 
	to making this game. The general flow was movment system, pickups, health and damage, enemy movement, 
	enviormental hazards (bubble vents) and finally bringing it all together with art and animations that were all 
	made by me.

	<header class="descriptionhead"> Node JS Discord Bot</header>
	<p	class="projectinfo" style="font-family:  proxima-nova, Times New Roman;">
	Working on my Discord Bot with Node JS was a lot of fun. It was my first introduction to JavaScript. Using node
	was very familiar to me since I am used to using python on Cent OS at work. I originally started this project to
	learn more about request and how to make calls to an API. This bot ended up being a lot of fun and pulled from Riot
	games API to provide stats about players in my Discord server.

	<p	class="projectinfo" style="font-family:  proxima-nova, Times New Roman;">
	Suprise! I wrote the website you are currently on! This projects goal started out to be purely functional, but
	it was a lot of fun too. Much like my passion for making video games, this website gave me a since of creation 
	and pride when making it. I hope you enjoy it and reach out to me!
