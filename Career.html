		<p class="jobinfo">
		My current job involves working on AWS servers at the time of production.
		After a server is constructed on an assembly line, it will run around 18 hours
		of tests. If any of the testing fails my job is to find out why the server failed,
		which involves a combonation of python/bash scripting for variouse stress test and 
		hardware detection, and physically looking at the servers. Jabil provides an excelent
		foundation for low level computing to build on.

		<p class="jobinfo">
		My responsiblities while working at RDI was supporting the team leads and call center 
		employees under me. What this entailed was monitoring their preformance data via tools
		such as Orcale, Excel, and Tableu. I would have to resolve escelated issues, provide 
		technical support, and use effective communication to coach and develop employees.
		Managing teams of up to 30 people taught me so much about emotional intelligence and
		how it can help me in any job or industy.

		Working at TQL was a cold call sales job with the goal to aquire new customers that
		I would then handle company logistics for. While working here I was able to work with
		companies that moved 100s of semi-freight trucks and manage them all effectivly. The
		most imporatant thing any cold call job can teach you is persistence and the right
		attitude will lead to results.
