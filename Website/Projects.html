    <header class="descriptionhead"> Interactive Systems Prototype</header>
	<p	class="aboutme">
        This project was made with 3 goals in mind. I wanted to learn how multiplayer replication worked,
        learn more about dynamic interaction systems, and how to use unreal's UMG system. In this prototype I was 
        able to write a c++ based invnetory and interaction system that is multiplayer compatible and component based
        so that I am able to attach an inventory or interaction to any Actor in the the world. In addition to that
        I was able to make a main menu, character creation system and local multiplayer that can connect 
        via himatchi all in the ui.

	<p	class="aboutme">
        Tic Tac Glow was made around the time I was planning on making the interaction prototype. I set out
        to test my new found knowledge on replication in video games. I spent a weekend practicing the techniques
        that I learned and how to better scope games for myself. The video is presnted more in an entertainment 
        style since that I wanted at the time, but it will give you a change to know me a little better!

    <header class="descriptionhead"> SeaTek Treasure Recovery </header>
	<p	class="aboutme">
        Underwater game design is hard. Not a programming lession, but a lesson I learned making this game. SeaTek 
        Treasure recovery was made in 7 days for an itch.io game jam. It was the first time I was able to due things 
        the right way and have a heavy focus on functionality then assets. Its a mistake I made with my interaction system 
        prototype that I do not want to make again. To the left you will see a video montage of all the steps I took to making 
        this game. The general flow was movment system, pickups, health and damage, enemy movement, enviormental hazards 
        (bubble vents) and finally bringing it all together with art and animations that were all made by me.
