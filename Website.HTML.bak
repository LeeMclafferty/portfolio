		I am a Gameplay programmer and software enthusiast that has the goal to never stop learning. My most  
		Prominet strength in anything I do is my undeniable work ethic. I have spent the last 2 years learning how to  
		program and then translating that skill into making games. Although I love programming gameplay, I also have put in the  
		effort to learn other parts of the game development pipeline such as shaders, concept art, and asset modeling. With my 
		current knowledge, my background in server scripting, and my experience in management I have developed many technical 
		skills and the ability to effectively communicate with any team.
