        I am a gameplay programmer and software enthusiast with the life long
        goal to never stop learning. My greatest strength is my work ethic,
        which is fueled by my undeniable drive to improve in everything that I
        do. I have spent the last two years using online resources to teach
        myself how to program, and have now translated that skill into creating
        my games. While Programming gameplay is a passion of mine, I have also
        branched out into other parts of game development to understand the
        entire process. Some of the other game development areas that I have
        explored include but are not limited to: shaders, concept art, and asset
        modeling. The combination of my current knowledge and my professional
        background in server scripting and management puts me in a unique
        position as I possess both technical skills and the communication skills
        required to effectively work with a team.

              Hi I'm Lee, but to left, you can see my current WIP Hi, I'm Ron. This game is my attempt to make a small,
              but well-polished game. I also want to have a big focus on well-written, unit-testable code, since that is something
              that is missing from some of my older projects. I am working on this project with the mindset "I am the programmer",
              but what does that mean? Well in Hi, I'm Ron I am using the story from one of my favorite podcasts and art from outside
              sources such as Sketchfab and other asset stores. This will be a 1 - 2 level game which the objective is to solve a 
              puzzle and reveal the key to exit the bad memory from Ron's childhood.

              Artificial intelligence is something that fascinates me and I want to continue exploring it. In this project
              I wanted to dive into the source code behind Behavior Trees and Tasks in Unreal Engine. This was a great
              first experience with AI and seeing exactly what dependencies go into the system outside of blueprint scripting.

              This project was made with three goals in mind. I wanted to learn how multiplayer replication worked,
              learn more about dynamic interaction systems, and how to use unreal's UMG system. In this prototype, I was 
              able to write a c++ based inventory and interaction system that is multiplayer compatible and component-based
              so that I can attach an inventory or interaction to any Actor in the world. In addition to that
              I was able to make the main menu, character creation system, and local multiplayer that can connect 
              via hamachi all in the UI.

              Tic Tac Glow was made around the time I was planning on making the interactive prototype. I set out
              to test my newfound knowledge on replication in video games. I spent a weekend practicing the techniques
              that I learned and how to better scope games for myself. The video is presented more in an entertainment 
              style that I wanted at the time, but it will give you a chance to know me a little better!

              Underwater game design is hard. Not a programming lesson, but a lesson I learned making this game. SeaTek 
              Treasure recovery was made in 7 days for an itch.io game jam. It was the first time I was able to do things 
              the right way and have a heavy focus on functionality then assets. It's a mistake I made with my interaction system 
              prototype that I do not want to make again. To the left, you will see a video montage of all the steps I took 
              to make this game. The general flow was movement system, pickups, health and damage, enemy movement, 
              environmental hazards (bubble vents) and finally bringing it all together with art and animations that were all 
              made by me.
