      <p>
        I am a self-taught gameplay programmer. I have spent the last two years using online resources 
        to teach myself how to program, and have created the portfolio of games seen below. While 
        gameplay programming is my main focus, I have also written shaders, created concept art, and 
        modelled assets as I have created my games.

              "Hi, I'm Ron" is a game that I am responsible for the C++ code driving the game. This game explores core gameplay 
              concepts needed in any game such as triggered events, run time actor generation interactions, physics systems,
              and the creation of editor tool for designers.

              With the use of Unreal's navigation system, I was able to create an AI that utilizes all game AI fundamentals. 
              The result demonstrates the use of behavior trees, tasks, Keys, decorators, and AI perception systems.

              This prototypes demonstrates my understanding of server client relationships in game programming. The replicated  
              systems displayed are character creating, inventory, lootables, equipment, and spawning. Each system utilizes  
              various replication methods such as remote procedure calls, replicated variables, and rep notifications with those  
              variables.

              Tic Tac glow was made in just over 24 hours for an Itch.io game jam and was built on Unreal's replication system. 
              This project was able to solidify my understanding of replication since there was an enforced 
              time limit. In this jam, I was the only replicated game and had to opportunity to integrate 3rd party listen 
              server hosting via Hamachi.

              SeaTek Treasure Recovery was made for an itch.io game jam in 7 days. The game marked my first time as a developer that I was able 
              to bring together all of my accumulated skills to have a small, but complete game with no outside assets. In addition I took the 
              opportunity to use common planning tools to keep production organized; tools such as Trello, Google docs, and Milanote.
