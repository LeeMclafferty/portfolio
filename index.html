        I am a self-taught gameplay programmer. I’ve spent the last two years using online resources 
        to teach myself how to program, and have created the portfolio of games seen below. While 
        gameplay programming is my main focus, I have also written shaders, created concept art, and 
        modelled assets as I have created my games.

              "Hi, I'm Ron" is a game that I am responsible for the C++ code driving the game. This game explores core gameplay 
              concepts needed in any game such as triggered events, run time actor generation and interactions, physics systems,
              and the creation of editor tool for designers.

              Artificial intelligence is something that fascinates me and I want to continue exploring it. In this project
              I wanted to dive into the source code behind Behavior Trees and Tasks in Unreal Engine. This was a great
              first experience with AI and seeing exactly what dependencies go into the system outside of blueprint scripting.

              This prototypes demonstrates my understanding of server client relationships in game programming. The replicated  
              systems displayed are character creating, inventory, lootables, equipment, and spawning. Each system utilizes  
              various replication methods such as remote procedure calls, replicated variables, and rep notifications with those  
              variables.

              Tic Tac glow was made in just over 24 hours for an Itch.io game jam. The game was made in just over 24 hours and was based 
              in unreal replication system. This project was able to solidify my understanding of replication since there was an enforced 
              time limit. In this jam, I was the only replicated game and had to opportunity to integrate 3rd party listen server hosting 
              via Hamachi.

              Underwater game design is hard. Not a programming lesson, but a lesson I learned making this game. SeaTek 
              Treasure recovery was made in 7 days for an itch.io game jam. It was the first time I was able to do things 
              the right way and have a heavy focus on functionality then assets. It's a mistake I made with my interaction system 
              prototype that I do not want to make again. To the left, you will see a video montage of all the steps I took 
              to make this game. The general flow was movement system, pickups, health and damage, enemy movement, 
              environmental hazards (bubble vents) and finally bringing it all together with art and animations that were all 
              made by me.
